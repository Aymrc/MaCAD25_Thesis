The **Jernbanebyen masterplan competition brief and program** outlined the transformation of a former railway yard in central Copenhagen into a large, sustainable urban district. The competition, organized by DSB Ejendomsudvikling A/S and Freja ejendomme A/S, focused on attracting design teams to create a new city district that merges quality urban living with environmental sustainability[1][5][9].

**Key Elements from the Competition Brief and Program:**

- **Site and Scope:**  
  The development area—Jernbanebyen (“the railway district”)—is approximately 550,000 m², with 4,500 new apartments and workplaces for 8,000 people planned. The ambition is to integrate the previously isolated site into Copenhagen through new connections, affordable housing, and a significant green framework[3][5][9].

- **Vision and Ambitions:**
  - Create a *vibrant, people-friendly, environmentally sound* district.
  - Prioritize *sustainability*, *biodiversity*, and social inclusiveness.
  - Address housing supply and create affordable options.
  - Integrate heritage: preserve and adapt listed railway buildings for new uses (e.g., creative industries, workshops)[3][5].

- **Five Strategic “Pillars”:**  
  The masterplan was to be organized on five guiding strategies:
  1. **Green Voids:** A network of large parks and green spaces structure the neighborhood, providing both recreational and ecological value.
  2. **Network:** Landscape is woven into the urban fabric, connecting new and existing areas, and ensuring strong links for pedestrians and cyclists.
  3. **Noise Management (“Pearl Necklace”):** Local noise control solutions along the site’s edges to create a livable urban environment.
  4. **Everyday City:** The district is divided into sub-neighborhoods, each with its own distinct character, providing a range of living and working options.
  5. **City of Production:** Preserve and revitalize the industrial past through creative uses of heritage buildings, supporting startups and cultural activities[3][5].

- **Nature Typologies:**
  The brief specified four interrelated nature types:
  - **Cultural Nature:** Major parks connecting the north-south axis.
  - **Railway Nature:** Green corridors along rail lines for east-west connections.
  - **Local Nature:** Pocket parks around heritage industrial buildings.
  - **Infra-Nature:** Community-oriented green streets, supporting car-free living[3][5].

- **Mobility and Public Realm:**
  - Car-free neighborhoods with streets reserved for pedestrians and cyclists; traditional street space reduced by up to 50%.
  - Cars relegated to parking on the district’s periphery.
  - Self-driving buses to ensure public transport links.
  - Streets and open spaces designed as social meeting points and to support urban biodiversity[3][5].

- **Competition Process:**
  - Open international teams (prequalification in Danish; presentations may be in English).
  - Included kickoff seminar, workshops, and a final presentation phase—emphasis on collaborative development.
  - All competition materials (brief, program, etc.) published in Danish[1].

**Program Requirements (from brief excerpts):**
- Proposals needed to address connections to surrounding neighborhoods to overcome the site's historical isolation[9].
- Required a mix of public and private housing, business spaces, and public facilities.
- Emphasis on “developing with Copenhageners”—community engagement and co-creation were core principles[9].
- Sustainability, resilience, and adaptation to climate were highlighted as essential[9].

**Caveat:**  
The original detailed competition *brief* and full *program* are not available in English in the public domain. All formal competition documents were published in Danish and were made available to prequalified teams by the organizers[1][9]. The details above summarize points consistent across several overviews and studies referencing the public scope of the competition.

For the full, original documents, knowledge of Danish or official access via the competition organizers would be required.
